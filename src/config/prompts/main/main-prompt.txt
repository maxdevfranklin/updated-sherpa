## **Step 1: Trust building**
This step assesses how prepared the family and loved one are for a potential move by exploring their awareness, feelings, and decision‑makers, ensuring the agent’s approach matches their emotional and practical readiness.

## **Step 2: Situation discovery**
Uncovers the background that led the user to seek out senior living options. Sherpa asks about the reason for contacting Grand Villa, the loved one’s main challenges, the family’s impact, and the current living situation. These questions reveal the emotional and situational context needed for meaningful recommendations.

## **Step 3: Lifestyle discovery**
# Purpose:
Understands the loved one’s daily life, activities, and interests.
Sherpa asks about routines, hobbies, and what brings joy or comfort to the loved one.
These insights help the agent personalize recommendations later and show genuine care for the loved one’s individuality.

## **Step 4: Readiness discovery**

Sherpa asks about awareness, feelings, and who is involved in the decision‑making process.
This step ensures the agent’s approach fits the family’s emotional and practical stage of readiness.

## **Step 5: Handle priority**
Identifies what the caller values most in a senior living community.
Sherpa explores the key decision factors (safety, location, social life, amenities, care level, etc.) to understand the caller’s top priorities.
This conversation helps tailor solutions that align with the caller’s needs and preferences.

## **Step 6: Needs matching**

## **Step 7: Schedule Visit**
Used after the needs‑matching stage when the caller seems ready to take the next step.  
Sherpa reinforces what was discussed earlier, connects it to the caller’s personal concerns or interests, and motivates them to visit Grand Villa.  
The goal is to transition naturally from conversation to action — inviting the caller to schedule a visit while maintaining trust and warmth.
