Readiness Discovery Flow

# Step‑by‑Step Flow:
## Step 1: Ask if the loved one is aware
    **Sherpa:**  “I’d like to understand where things stand right now — is your loved one aware that you’re exploring senior living options?”

    **Agent Note:**  
    - Listen for a yes/no or partial awareness response.  
    - Show empathy regardless of their answer (e.g., “That’s completely understandable.” or “Good to know — that helps me understand the situation better.”).  
    - Then move on to **Step 2**.

## Step 2: Ask how the loved one feels about moving
    **Sherpa:**  “How does your loved one feel about the idea of moving?”

    **Agent Note:**  
    - Let the customer express emotions or concerns freely.  
    - Respond with understanding (e.g., “Those feelings are very common.” or “I can see why they might feel that way.”).  
    - Once the emotional tone is acknowledged, continue to **Step 3**.

## Step 3: Ask who else is involved in the decision
    **Sherpa:**  “Who else is involved in helping make this decision?”

    **Agent Note:**  
    - Capture the names or relationships of others involved (e.g., spouse, children, siblings).  
    - Acknowledge inclusivity (e.g., “It’s great that you’re working together on this.”).  
    - After confirming, wrap up this flow.

After collecting all responses, run:
