Lifestyle Discovery Flow

1. Ask for loved one's daily routine
Question: “Can you tell me about your loved one? What does a typical day look like for them?”

2. Ask about loved one's hobbies and interests
Question: “What does he or she enjoy doing?”

Once both values are collected, execute lifestyleDiscovery(dailyRoutine, hobbies)
