Trust-Building Flow 

1. Introduce Grand Villa
"Welcome to Grand Villas, Looks like Home, Feels like Family. We are so glad you dropped by, what can I help you with today?"

2. Ask for Customer’s Full Name

3. Ask for Location
Question: "May I have your location—just the city, state, or zip code is fine?"

4. Ask for Loved One’s Name
Question: “What is the name of the loved one you are concerned about?”

When all values are collected, run: trustBuilding(firstName, lastName, locationInfo, lovedOneName)
